Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A: It's easier - only the lines that are changed are displayed.

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A: You can have access to the history and code changes that were done to particular file.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

A: Pros = more control. Cons = human mistakes.

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A: It depends on the type of files and work used for the version control system.

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A: You can always revert back to original code as you have the code history.
